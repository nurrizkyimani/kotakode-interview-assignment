This project contains the source code to a simple mini-todo list that helps people keeps track of their "Pekerjaan Rumah Tangga". Some of the features are not yet fully functioning. 

## 1. Your first task is to find what causes it not to work and fix them.

Minimum working features required:
1. ability to add pekerjaan.
2. ability to view pekerjaan.
3. ability to delete pekerjaan.

This project uses React. In order to run the application development server, please fork this github repository and pull the codebase to your machine. Then, go to the client folder by running the command `cd client`, and run `npm run start`.

Tip: There is a React component called `TodoList` in `src/TodoList.jsx` which will receive some props from the root component `App` in `src/App.jsx`. Feel free to add ts many props as you like to make it work.

## 2. After you are done with the basic implementation, write appropriate automated tests to make sure the app is running.

Both `App.jsx` and `TodoList.jsx` have their corresponding test files called `App.test.jsx` and `TodoList.test.jsx`. In order to ensure your component (and therefore your application) works correctly, you should write test that covers enough cases to guarantee that users will not break the application.

## 3. Get creative! (The fun part)

Feel free to use your imagination to implmeent cooler features! Maybe you can allow users to set a timer, or set the color of the todo list items to indicate priority, or moving todo list up and down - anything you like, impress us with your creativity!
